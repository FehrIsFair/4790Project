But there’s no way he could have known that his decision to stop chasing professional success and instead concentrate on his oath to save peoples’ lives would result in the birth of an abomination. The questions of good and evil now take on a terrifyingly real dimension.\n<br><br>\nYears later, in Germany during the tumultuous post-reunification period, middle-aged childless couples are being killed one after another. The serial killer’s identity is known. The reasons why he kills are not. Dr. Tenma sets out on a journey to find the killer’s twin sister, who may hold some clues to solving the enigma of the “Monster.”\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)",

Bearer of a gigantic sword, an iron hand, and the scars of countless battles and tortures, his flesh is also indelibly marked with The Brand, an unholy symbol that draws the forces of darkness to him and dooms him as their sacrifice. But Guts won't take his fate lying down; he'll cut a crimson swath of carnage through the ranks of the damned—and anyone else foolish enough to oppose him! Accompanied by Puck the Elf, more an annoyance than a companion, Guts relentlessly follows a dark, bloodstained path that leads only to death...or vengeance.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Dark Horse)<br>\n<br>\n<b>Chapter Notes:</b><br>\n<i>- Volumes 1-5 contain the 16 prequel chapters 0A through 0P before the chapter count properly begins with “Chapter 1: Sword Wind” in Volume 5.<br>\n- <a href=\"https://anilist.co/manga/95821/Berserk-Shinen-no-Kami-2/\">Chapter 83</a> was omitted from Volume 13 and was never released in volume format due to the author’s request.<br>\n- Volume 14 includes “<a href=\"https://anilist.co/manga/36408/Berserk-The-Prototype/\">Berserk: The Prototype</a>”, the original one-shot that the manga was based on.</i>",

The population has been considerably reduced and political and technological institutions have broken-down. Local communities have become nations and telephone and television no longer exist (although coffee vending machines and streetlights stubbornly continue to work).

Along with the human population are some intelligent, humanoid robots. One of the robots, a female named Alpha, runs a cafe by the same name in the country outside of what remains of Yokohama. With her trusty motorscooter and her camera she travels around the area making friends with the humans and robots, having new experiences and observing the passage of time.<br><br><i>Note: Includes the epilogue, Touge, published with the 10 volume re-issue.

The next morning, however, Kazuki is left wondering whether it was all a dream. Lo and behold, the girl, the monster, and his death are all real! The girl, Tokiko Tsumura, was actually trying to slay the homunculus (a beast that can take the form of humans, but whose main source of food is people), but Kazuki got in her way. To revive Kazuki, Tokiko replaces his heart with a \"kakugane,\" an alchemic device that allows him to summon a lance with which to fight the monsters. It turns out that Tokiko is a member of Renkin Kenshi (Alchemist Soldiers), an organization sworn to protect the world from the diabolical creatures. Soon, Kazuki joins Tokiko in her quest to terminate the sinister being that creates and controls the homunculus.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Viz Media)",
